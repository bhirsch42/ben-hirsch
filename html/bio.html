<div class="indent">My</div> name is Ben Hirsch, and I'm a Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Beyond programming, my interests include writing and theater, and as a result I'm particularly skilled in public speaking and explaining concepts. Since leaving high school, where I performed in a number of featured roles, I've joined Georgia Tech's improv troupe, "Let's Try This." Currently, I do on-demand web design and hosting with Google App Engine for a company called The Paper Route, where I design and deploy RSVP websites. I also work at The Temple tutoring children with learning differences in reading Hebrew. My goals as a Computer Science student are fairly common: Start a great company if the right idea comes along, or join a great company if it does not. I make sure to always remember Randall Monroe's words: "I never trust anyone who's more excited about success than about doing the thing they want to be successful at." If I'm on the right side of that line, I know I'll be alright.
